Of course. Working with a pre-built image changes the user's perspective significantly. The `README.md` should focus on how to *use* the container, not how to *build* it.

Based on this new premise, I have revised the `README.md` to reflect the final state of our container (v1.7) and to be a user guide for the pre-built image available on a container registry like Docker Hub.

### Revised `README.md`

## 🔍 Overview

This VS Code Dev Container provides a pre-configured environment for developing PySpark applications. It eliminates the "works on my machine" problem by ensuring all developers pull an identical, pre-built environment from a container registry with consistent versions of Python, Spark, and related libraries.

The container is optimized for data engineering and data science workflows that require:
- Interactive data exploration with Apache Zeppelin.
- Processing large datasets with Apache Spark.
- Training models with state-of-the-art gradient boosting libraries.
- Querying and analyzing data in Google BigQuery.

## ✨ What's New in v1.7

-   **Apache Zeppelin:** Added for web-based, interactive data exploration and visualization.
-   **Enhanced ML Toolkit:** Now includes **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**, and **CatBoost**.
-   **XGBoost for Spark:** The environment is ready for distributed XGBoost training.
-   **Robust Startup:** The container now manages its own service startup sequence internally for better stability.

## ✨ Features

-   **Pre-built Image:** Pulls directly from a container registry for a fast, firewall-friendly setup.
-   **Apache Spark 3.5.3:** Pre-installed and configured to start automatically.
-   **Apache Zeppelin 0.11.1:** Pre-installed and running for interactive notebooks.
-   **Google Cloud SDK:** Ready for BigQuery authentication and access.
-   **VS Code Integration:** Comes with recommended extensions for Python and GCP development.
-   **UI Access:** Key ports (Spark, Zeppelin) are forwarded for easy access from your browser.
-   **Secure by Default:** Runs with a non-root `vscode` user.

## 🖥️ System Prerequisites

-   **Docker Desktop** (Windows/Mac) or Docker Engine (Linux)
-   **Visual Studio Code** with the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) installed
-   **Git** for version control
-   A **Google Cloud Platform** account with BigQuery access
-   At least **8GB RAM** allocated to Docker

## 🚀 Getting Started

This setup uses a pre-built image, so you do not need to build the container locally.

1.  **Clone this Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/your-project.git
    cd your-project
    ```

2.  **Open in VS Code:**
    ```bash
    code .
    ```

3.  **Start the Dev Container:**
    -   VS Code will detect the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file and show a notification in the bottom-right corner.
    -   Click **"Reopen in Container"**.

VS Code will now pull the `your-registry/data-science-container:1.7` image and start the container. This will be much faster than a local build.

## ✅ Verifying Your Setup

Once the container is running, you can verify the environment:

1.  **Check Services in Terminal:** Open a new terminal in VS Code (`Terminal` > `New Terminal`) and run:
    ```bash
    jps
    # Expected output: A list of Java processes including 'Master', 'Worker', and 'ZeppelinServer'
    ```

2.  **Check Zeppelin UI:**
    -   Open your browser and navigate to **http://localhost:8090**. You should see the Zeppelin welcome page.

3.  **Check Spark Master UI:**
    -   Open your browser and navigate to **http://localhost:8080**. You should see the Spark Master dashboard.

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Running a Distributed XGBoost Job

The container is ready for distributed training with XGBoost on Spark. To use it, you must configure your SparkSession to download the required package.

1.  Create a Python file (e.g., `test_spark_xgboost.py`).
2.  Use the following code to initialize your SparkSession. This tells Spark to fetch the XGBoost package for the session.
    ```python
    from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

    spark = (
        SparkSession.builder.appName("SparkXGBoostTest")
        .master("spark://localhost:7077")
        .config("spark.jars.packages", "ml.dmlc:xgboost4j-spark_2.12:2.0.3")
        .getOrCreate()
    )
    # ... your distributed XGBoost code here ...
    ```
3.  Run the script from the VS Code terminal: `python test_spark_xgboost.py`.

### Using the XGBoost Plugin in Zeppelin

To enable distributed XGBoost in your Zeppelin notebooks, you need to perform a one-time configuration:

1.  Navigate to the Zeppelin UI (`http://localhost:8090`).
2.  Click the user menu (top-right) and select **Interpreter**.
3.  Find the `spark` interpreter and click the **edit** button.
4.  Scroll down to the **Dependencies** section.
5.  Under **Artifact**, enter the Maven coordinate: `ml.dmlc:xgboost4j-spark_2.12:2.0.3`
6.  Click **Save** and restart the interpreter when prompted.

## 📚 Included Libraries

The environment comes with these key Python packages pre-installed. See the source repository's `requirements.txt` for the full list.

| Library | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **pyspark** | Python API for Apache Spark distributed computing |
| **google-cloud-bigquery** | Google Cloud client library for BigQuery integration |
| **pandas, polars, numpy** | Core libraries for data manipulation and analysis |
| **scikit-learn** | Foundational machine learning library |
| **xgboost, lightgbm, catboost** | High-performance gradient boosting frameworks |
| **matplotlib, seaborn, plotly** | Comprehensive libraries for creating visualizations |
| **delta-spark** | Delta Lake integration for Spark (ACID transactions) |
| **pytest, black, flake8** | Tools for testing, formatting, and linting |

## ❓ Troubleshooting

-   **Error pulling image:** If Docker fails to pull the image, check your internet connection and ensure you are logged into Docker Hub (`docker login`). If you are behind a corporate firewall, ensure `hub.docker.com` is allowed.
-   **`Connection refused` on port 7077:** The container's startup script includes a delay to prevent a race condition where services start too quickly. If you still see this error, the container may have failed to start its services. Check the container logs in VS Code (`View` > `Output`, select `Dev Containers` from the dropdown) for more details.
-   **Permission Denied in `/workspace`:** This can happen if the `workspaceMount` is not configured correctly. Ensure your `devcontainer.json` includes the `workspaceMount` and `remoteUser: 'vscode'` properties.

## 🔧 For Maintainers

This repository contains the configuration for *using* the pre-built dev container. The source files (`Dockerfile`, etc.) used to build and publish new versions of the image are located in a separate maintainer repository.
